## Project Description

The Workout Backend API provides endpoints to manage workout routines, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting workout data. It uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and Alembic for database migrations.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations for workout routines
- Database migrations with Alembic
- Modular routing with Flask blueprints

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)
- PostgreSQL (or any other preferred database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khking435/workout-backend-.git
   cd workout-backend-
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables (e.g., in a `.env` file):

   ```env
   FLASK_APP=app.py
   FLASK_ENV=development
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname
   ```

5. Initialize Alembic for database migrations:

   ```bash
   alembic init alembic
   ```

6. Configure Alembic by editing `alembic.ini` and `alembic/env.py` to match your database settings and models.

7. Create and apply the initial migration:

   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Server

Start the Flask development server:

```bash
flask run
```

The server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
